Hi! Im Owen and I am a 3rd year student at the University of New South Wales (as of 2022). I am taking a 5 year double degree program in Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Science (Computer Science).

My main goals are to learn and master the art of software design to a level where I have the ability to independently build robust software.

On this profile, there will mainly be individual personal projects in a variety of languages including Python, Java and C++.
